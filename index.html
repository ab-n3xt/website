    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Aidan Buchanan. I study Computer Science at Ryerson University. I also play(ed) a lot of video games. I love music. Music is awesome! My main focus right now is trying to find out what to focus on... (<i>yeah, I know.</i>)
      <br>
      Within Computer Science, I'm interested in one thing: software.
      <br>
      Why is that? Well, I don't know a lot about the specific branches within Computer Science. However, software was one of the earliest branches I was introduced to (as I'm sure many others like myself). I guess you can say I am clinging onto what I am comfortable with.
      <br>
      Three other areas I do find interesting are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web Development (like now)</li>
      <li>Audio</li>
      <li>Database</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This blog will mostly be for me to examine my thoughts and to get an understanding of where I want to go with life. I still find it difficult sometimes to focus on one specific thing and do it well. Maybe I'll post these to the public some day to inform others of my journey so others can learn.

    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>
      I want to be a high school teacher. There is nothing more nobler than guiding the lost youth of today. Kids are fragile. Kids are influenced by things around them every day. This is an important key aspect about them. They learn a lot from their peers and from what they experience. In this <b>Information Age</b>, I think this idea has turned against the young people. Social media and the Internet overwhelms the kids. Makes them think too hard. Makes them try to please everyone but not themselves. I want to be able to teach kids not only the material they need to learn, but to make sure they understand why they are learning it and keep them away from memorizing the material.
      <aside>
        I notice a lot of students have trouble with word-problems in math for example. That is because they don't understand what the formulas truly do. They just know certain circumstances where the formula can be applicable and the teachers give questions that follow the same format. Therefore, students memorize the pattern, rather than understand what's really happening when they solve a problem. This needs to change.
      </aside>
      <br>
      One of my early realizations about learning was to get rid of my ego and to ask questions, regardless if I'm suddenly viewed lower than my peers (to be honest, I'm not sure this actually happened). It pushed my own understanding and therefore, I had greater confidence in what I believed to be the right answer, because I had the knowledge to back up my answers.
      <br>
      A similar mentality is the idea of self-image. People try their best to please others. However, the important aspect is pleasing yourself.

                    My friend introduced me to Tool back in 2014 when we were in high school. He told me about one of their albums, an album called Lateralus. He was talking about how in-depth their music was, how it all related to math equations and concepts. I was intrigued. Later that day, I took a listen on my computer.

                    2019 has come to an end. I'd say it's been a pretty good year, but I hope it's better in 2020. This blog post will be just a recount of books I've read, songs I've learned.

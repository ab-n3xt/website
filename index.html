    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Aidan Buchanan. I study Computer Science at Ryerson University. I also play(ed) a lot of video games. I love music. Music is awesome! My main focus right now is trying to find out what to focus on... yeah, I know.
      <br>
      Within Computer Science, I'm interested in one thing: software.
      <br>
      Why is that? Well, I don't know a lot about the specific branches within Computer Science and software is one branch that I know mostly what it is about.

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Aidan Buchanan. I study Computer Science at Ryerson University. I also play(ed) a lot of video games. I love music. Music is awesome! My main focus right now is trying to find out what to focus on... (<i>yeah, I know.</i>)
      <br>
      Within Computer Science, I'm interested in one thing: software.
      <br>
      Why is that? Well, I don't know a lot about the specific branches within Computer Science. However, software was one of the earliest branches I was introduced to (as I'm sure many others like myself). I guess you can say I am clinging onto what I am comfortable with.
      <br>
      Three other areas I do find interesting are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web Development (like now)</li>
      <li>Audio</li>
      <li>Database</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This blog will mostly be for me to examine my thoughts and to get an understanding of where I want to go with life. I still find it difficult sometimes to focus on one specific thing and do it well. Maybe I'll post these to the public some day to inform others of my journey so others can learn.

    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>
      I want to be a high school teacher. There is nothing more nobler than guiding the lost youth of today. Kids are fragile. Kids are influenced by things around them every day. This is an important key aspect about them. They learn a lot from their peers and from what they experience. In this <b>Information Age</b>, I think this idea has turned against the young people. Social media and the Internet overwhelms the kids. Makes them think too hard. Makes them try to please everyone but not themselves. I want to be able to teach kids not only the material they need to learn, but to make sure they understand why they are learning it and to ask questions.
      <br>
      One of my early realizations about learning was to get rid of my ego and to ask questions, regardless if I'm suddenly viewed lower than my peers (whether or not that actually occurred). It pushes your own understanding and therefore, you are more confident in what you think is the right answer.
      <br>
      A similar mentality is the idea of self-image. People try their best to please others. However, the important aspect is pleasing yourself.

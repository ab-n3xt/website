			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			<p>I graduated from Toronto Metropolitan University with a with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in 2022.</p>
			<p>I used to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive in a semi-professional capacity from 2015-2021. I represented organizations <strong>Ryerson Esports</strong> and <strong>Volante</strong> and attended LAN events such as <strong>Dreamhack Montreal 2019</strong> and <strong>LANWAR at UoIT</strong>.</p>
			<p>One of my favourite pastimes is going to concerts for my favourite bands. Some of the concerts I went to include <strong>System of a Down</strong>, <strong>Ghost</strong>, <strong>Slipknot</strong>, <strong>King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard</strong>, <strong>Opeth</strong>, <strong>Elder</strong>, <strong>Khemmis</strong>, and <strong>Tool</strong>.</p>
			<p>Another pastime is going camping with friends and running long distances.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, I'm coding and honing my skills so that I can start applying for developer positions.</p>

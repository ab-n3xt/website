			My sense of humour (Yami, bash.org):<br>
			Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by cannibals.
			The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they pass a trial.
			The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit.
			So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.<br><br>
			The first one came back and said to the king, "I brought ten
			apples." The king then explained the trial to him. "You have to
			shove the fruits up your ass without any expression on your
			face or you'll be eaten."<br><br>
			The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out
			in pain, so he was killed.<br><br>
			The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the
			king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this
			should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the
			ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.<br><br>
			The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one
			asked, "Why did you laugh? You almost got away with it" The
			second one replied, "I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy
			coming with pineapples."<br><br>

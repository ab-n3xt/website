                <p>
                    My friend Luis introduced me to Tool back in 2014 when we were in high school. He told me about one of their albums, an album called Lateralus. He was talking about how in-depth their music was, how it all related to math equations and concepts. I was intrigued. Later that day, I took a listen on my computer.<br>
                    <br>
                    It was pretty cool.<br>
                    <br>
                    Something I had never heard in my life. However, it didn't click with me. I think I wasn't at that certain point in my life yet, like I wasn't mature.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moving on to 2017, just starting university, I had stumbled upon a video on YouTube. A live performance of Tool back in 1992 in Philly. I thought, "oh yeah, I remember Tool, let's see how they were back then".<br>
                    <br>
                    This video blew me away.<br>
                    <br>
                    It starts with Maynard and the gang getting ready on their small, claustrophobic stage in a bar-lit venue. Then, without any introduction, Danny starts drumming away, right into "Part of Me", a track off of their Opiate EP.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is fast and hard-hitting.<br>
                    <br>
                    Center stage is Maynard, staring down the crowd. Adam blasts away on his guitar, letting the audience know he means business, and Paul chugs on his low tone, 5-string bass guitar.<br>
                    <br>
                    What really makes the video is Maynard. The way he sings, the way he presents himself. At first, he's seems like a weird guy. But, he's truly being human in that moment. Pure, raw emotion and energy. It's such a joy to watch.<br>
                    <br>
                    After this video, I was hooked right in. Now I listen to Tool almost every day.<br>

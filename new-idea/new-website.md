# New Website

Starts with a black screen and then a white square appears
Person clicks on it and the door comes towards the user
It reveals an open landscape, and then the website fades in

Background: Mountain, trees, village (smoke coming out of chimneys), birds flying out of trees, pixelated (maybe)
White, minimalist design
Fading animations

Create program that will parse Markdown files to HTML (writing blogs will be easier)

I started my Job Hunt of 2023. I had one mindset: get a programming job.

Nothing else.

Just... get a programming job. Something to gain that sense of security.

After the first month of no responses from companies, I decided to do some research on more effective cover letters.

I stumbled upon a thread on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35397271) and saw _jensneuse_'s comment: 

```
Simply answer the following 2 questions briefly in plain English.

1. Why do you want to take this role?
2. Why are you a good fit for this role?
```

It was very sound advice, and I'm sure the employers wouldn't mind it either. However, it made me question a lot of positions I applied for. I did not answer those questions, rather just splay my experience on a document and hope my future employer can connect the dots and see that I am a good fit.

From now on, I shall seek opportunities that better align with my experience and clearly write it out.

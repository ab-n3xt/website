I started my Job Hunt of 2023. I had one mindset: get a programming job.

Nothing else.

Just... get a programming job. Something to gain that sense of security.

After the first month of no responses from companies, I decided to do some research on more effective cover letters.

I stumbled upon a thread on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35397271) and saw _jensneuse_'s comment: 

```
Simply answer the following 2 questions briefly in plain English.

1. Why do you want to take this role? (Q1)
2. Why are you a good fit for this role? (Q2)
```

It was very sound advice (I'm sure the employers wouldn't mind it either). However, it made me question a lot of positions I applied for. I either applied to jobs I wasn't really interested in (*making Q1 hard to answer*), or applied to jobs with excessive/unclear details (*making Q2 hard to see*).

From now on, I have learned to:

1. Seek opportunities that better align with my experience and values.
2. Clearly write it out to the employer.

Thank you _jensneuse_ for your advice.

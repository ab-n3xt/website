I started to watch [Lex Fridman's podcast with Max Tegmark](https://youtu.be/VcVfceTsD0A) today and usually with long videos, I like to first look at the comments to get others' reaction. I see the first comment quoting something the guest says: "We're rushing towards a cliff, but the closer we get, the more scenic the views are." (in reference to AI development).

This is quite a powerful, and scary, statement for two reasons:

1. It shows how fast we are advancing as a species with the introduction of AI and technology associated with AI.
2. It shows how one of the most fatal flaws of ourselves, that most choose based on what gives us gain in the short term, will eventually lead us to our fall.

Sadly, I do not see society changing its perception to prepare for the reprecussions of reason number 2. I'm sure those capable of using AI can see its enormous benefit for monetary or power gain, and will stomp and continue to stomp on those who cry for AI's abolishment or cease of advancement.

It is hard to tell when we are apart of something that is incredibly important, but I think we are at some crossroad, and I have a small feeling that we are going down the wrong path. We are choosing what appears good in the short-term, but not good for the future.

Only time will tell, I suppose.
